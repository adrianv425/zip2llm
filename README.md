**Contributing - Let's Build This Together! ü§ù**

Zip2LLM is open-source and built by the community, for the community! We welcome contributions of all kinds to make this tool even better for everyone working with LLMs and code.

**Want to Contribute? Here's how:**

*   **Fork the Repository:**  Create your own copy of the repository to work on.
*   **Create a Branch:** Make your changes in a dedicated branch (e.g., `feature/amazing-enhancement` or `fix/that-pesky-bug`).
*   **Code and Commit:** Implement your awesome feature or bug fix. Please try to follow the existing styling and code structure.
*   **Styling Considerations:**  We aim for a clean and modern UI (as you can see!). If you're making UI-related changes, please try to maintain the current visual style and use the existing CSS variables in `src/App.css` for consistency.
*   **Test Your Changes:**  Ensure your changes are working as expected and don't introduce any regressions.
*   **Submit a Pull Request (PR):**  Once you're happy with your contribution, submit a PR to the `main` branch of the main repository.

**Areas Where You Could Shine (Contribution Ideas):**

*   **More Language Support:** Expand the language detection in `src/utils.js` to recognize even more programming languages and file types!
*   **File Filtering:** Add options to include or exclude files based on patterns or extensions before processing.
*   **Line Numbering:**  Include line numbers in the code blocks (optional feature) for even more precise context.
*   **Progress Indication:**  Implement a progress bar or loading indicator for larger zip files.
*   **Performance Optimizations:**  If you see any performance bottlenecks, especially with very large zip files, optimizations are always welcome!
*   **UI/UX Enhancements:**  Have a brilliant idea to make the UI even more delightful or user-friendly? We're all ears!
